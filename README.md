# airQualityDeepLearning: Analysis of Pakistan's Air Quality Data using Deep Learning Methods. 

## The problem:
In modern society Air pollution is a problem whose effects endanger the lives of
millions of people all across the world. One measure of Air quality is is PM2.5 or
Particulate Matter 2.5 which is the term used to describe solid particles that are
less then or equal to 2.5 micrometers in width. These Particles are suspended in
the air and can cause a host of health problems. 

## How we aim to solve it:
This project aims to create a PM2.5 forecasting system using Recurrent Neural Networks, these Neural Networks can
use past meteorological data to make predictions of future PM2.5 levels. 
This study, which is the **first of it's kind in Pakistan**, is an effort towards tackling the increasing threat of climate change and bad air quality in Pakistan. To find out more, read the [paper](https://github.com/ms03831/airQualityDeepLearning/blob/master/finalPaperAirQualityPrediction.pdf) that we produced at the end of this research. 

## Future direction: 
This is an on-going project, and we are looking for ways in which we could improve our results. 

## About the project:
This project was initiated in September of 2019, as part of a course project for our Deep Learning course at Habib University. The study was supervised by [Dr. Abdul Samad](https://habib.edu.pk/SSE/dr-abdul-samad/) and [Dr. Sarah Hasnain](https://habib.edu.pk/SSE/dr-abdul-samad/) of Habib University
